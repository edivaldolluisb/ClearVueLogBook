# B. Stage 1 - Context Definition

# B.1. Competitor Identification

>     The competitor analysis will entail an identification of all competitors, with brief descriptions and a collection of the look and feel of their solutions, e.g., with screenshots, etc. It will also include a detailed analysis of the competitor deemed the best or more representative. It ends with a summary of the main findings including an HCI SWOT analysis

## B.1a. Competitors

| **Competitor** | **Description**          | Information repository                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Opticalia      | Online eyewears platform | [Opticalia_evaluation_workbook](competitors/Competitor%20Analysis%20Opticalia.md) |
| Multioticas    | Online eyewears platform | [Opticalia_evaluation_workbook](competitors/Competitor%20Analysis%20Opticalia.md) |

## B.1b. Detailed Competitor Analysis

>     Choose the most notable competitor and do a more thorough analysis of their interactive solution

### - Heuristic Evaluation

Me and my mate we've selected Opticalia as our main competitor, And we have used Nielsen Norman Method.

#### Method

[ Describe the method used for the heuristic evaluation: procedure, number of experts, heuristics, severity scale considered, how was consensus done.]

We conducted a heuristic evaluation following the Nielsen Norman Method. The process involved:

-   Procedure: Each evaluator independently analyzed the Opticalia platform.

-   Number of Experts: 2 experts.

-   Heuristics Used: Nielsenâ€™s 10 Usability Heuristics.

-   Severity Scale: We assigned severity scores from 0 (no issue) to 4 (usability catastrophe).

-   Consensus: After individual assessments, a meeting was held to discuss and agree on the severity of issues.

#### Individual Evaluations

<!-- For the individual heuristic evaluations by each member of the group, you can use the templates below, grouping problems by heuristic OR each evaluator can have a table listing all the detected problems with the number of the violated heuristics on the second column. Whichever your choice, you should have a list of problems, the severity, and a recommendation to mitigate it -->

-   [expert2_heuristic_evaluation_workbook](heuristic_evaluations/expert2_heuristic_evaluation_Opticalia.md)

<!-- - [expert3_heuristic_evaluation_workbook](heuristic_evaluations/expert3_heuristic_evaluation_workbook.md) -->

#### Consensus

>     After the individual analysis by each expert, all results should be gathered in a consensus table. If an expert has not found any of the problems found by other experts, they should analyse it, at this point, and give it a severity.

| **Issue**                         | **Expert 1** | Expert 2 | Recommendations                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Confusing navigation structure    | 3            | 1        | Improve menu clarity and add a site map.        |
| Lack of feedback on button clicks | 2            | 3        | Use visual and audio cues for user interaction. |
| Complex checkout process          | 4            |          | Simplify steps and add progress indicators.     |

### - Cognitive Walkthrough

#### Method

[Briefly described the method you used for the Cognitive Walkthrough analysis. ]
The cognitive walkthrough focused on evaluating how a first-time user would interact with Opticaliaâ€™s platform. We analyzed the ease of learning and completing common tasks.

#### Task Selection and Task Analysis

[Which tasks did you select and why. What are the subtasks entailed for each ]

| Task                            | Subtasks                            |

# B.2. Users

>     For the users, there are two goals: 1) understand the current status of users in the domain you are addressing. How do they manage, what are the main tasks they do, if they use some tool for the purpose, what are current challenges, what might be improved, what might be new features, ...

## B.2a. Method

[What approach was followed to talk with users; what kind of users were considered. What was the goal of the interviews? What were the questions considered?]

We conducted structured interviews with users who have experience purchasing eyewear online. Our goal was to identify:

-   How users search for eyewear online.

-   Common challenges they face.

-   Features they would like to see improved.

**Interview Questions:**

1. Have you purchased eyewear online before? If so, what platform did you use?

2. What was the most difficult part of the process?

3. How did you choose the right glasses for you?

4. Were there any features you found helpful or lacking?

## B.2b. Results

>     This section tracks all informal user interviews, summarizing key insights and linking to detailed notes for each session.
