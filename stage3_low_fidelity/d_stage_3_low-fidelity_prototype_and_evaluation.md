## D.2. Prototype Evaluation

- We interviewed 8 participants to evaluate the low-fidelity prototype.
- The participants were asked to complete:
    - A task to buy a product from the website.
    - A task to schedule a eye test appointment.
    - The participants were asked to test the blog section

- Some feedback we received:
    - The participants liked how intuitive the website was.
    - They suggested to add an auto-complete feature in the schedule appointment section, for the location.
    - They suggested to add a search bar in the blog section, to make it easier to find articles.
    - They said it's missing shiping information when buying a product.
