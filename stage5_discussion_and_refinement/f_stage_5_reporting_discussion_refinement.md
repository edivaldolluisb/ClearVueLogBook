# F. Discussion of Evaluation Results


# Refinement List
- **Group 1**: 
    - Simple and intuitive interface
    - Useful functionalities
    - Suggestion to add more notifications and fix some bugs in scheduling
- **Group 2**:
    - The feedbacks were similar to group 1, but they also suggested making some changes to the navigation menu, as we have a submenu "others" that is not very intuitive.
